# Predictive-Modeling-Project
Final Project for STT capstone

Goal: Predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. So, **SalePrice** is the **Response** variable.

Metric: Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)
  ## Ignore Metric, this was submitted to Kaggle to produce these scores.
 
Evaluation: Class evaluation is based on the following methodologies: KNN Methods, Linear Regression, Subset Selection, Shrinkage Methods, Generalized Additive Models, Regression Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, and Boosting methods. Extracted from these models will be the Estimated Test Errors (CV Estimate) and True Test Errors.
